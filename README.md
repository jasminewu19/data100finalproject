# data100finalproject
Final Project for Data 100 Spring 2020. Research topic was on how a US county's implementation of social distancing measures predict the democratic to republican ratio for that county. I collaborated on this project with Gene Ho and Hannah Qi.

This project uses different methods and experiments to explore the relationship between
the implementation of social distancing measures and democratic to republican ratio for each
county in the U.S. The data was obtained from Johns Hopkins University. COVID-19 research is
being rapidly published, as it is an important public health crisis. Linear and logistic regressions
were performed to find models for this between political preference and social distancing order
implementation. The final logistic and log-linear models performed fairly well on our test set.
Assuming the coefficients for these models are significant, they should be suitable for modeling
the outcomesâ€™ relationship to the selected features.
